Task 1: Install Terraform
=========================
# After the EC2 server is up & running, SSH into the machine and do the below:
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname CICDLab
type bash 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget unzip -y
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.2.8/terraform_1.2.8_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.2.8_linux_amd64.zip
ls
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin
ls
terraform -v


Task 2: Install AWS CLI and Ansible, alternatively check the command document for Azure/GCP
===================================
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
sudo pip3 install awscli boto boto3 ansible

aws configure
Access Key ID: 
Secret Access Key: 

# If you need to create new credentials, Follow below steps
Go to aws console. On top right corner, click on your name or aws profile id. 
when the menu opens, click on Security Credentials
Under AWS IAM Credntials, click on Create access key. If you already have 2 active keys, 
you can deactivate and delete the older one so that you can create a new key


# Create hosts inventory file with the necessary permissions
 sudo mkdir /etc/ansible && sudo touch /etc/ansible/hosts
 sudo chmod 766 /etc/ansible/hosts


Task 3: Use terraform to launch 2 servers. 
==========================================
# We need 2 additional servers docker-server and jenkins-server
# You can use t2.micro for Docker/Jenkins

# Create the terraform directory and set up the config files in it
mkdir devops-labs && cd devops-labs

# As a first step, create a key using ssh-keygen.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 

# This will create id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/
# Keep the path as /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa; don't set up any passphrase
# Basically just hit 'Enter' key for the 3 questions it asks

# Now prepare the terraform config files.
The different files are on github, for AWS there will be 2 files Devopsserver.tf & variables.tf. Others will have only one

# Now, execute the terraform config files to launch the servers

terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply 

# After the terraform code is executed, check hosts inventory file and ensure below output (sample)
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
Or on the respective consoles
